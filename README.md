# Fauxnix Game
A simple game based on the 1980 hit game Phoenix!</br>

## Tech-Stack
* Reactjs
* SVG

## Description
It has been 100 years since the great alien corruption of the beloved phoenix.  You and your fleet of warships were successful in wiping out the aliens who were twisting the phoenix, however, their legacy remains!  The aliens are no longer feeding the phoenix radioactive material that was making them bomb societies flat.  The problem is the mutated phoenix continues to multiply!  Your mission: your ship has been stripped of shields (budget cuts) and we can equip it with 100 doses of "Population Control".  You are to administer as many doses as you can before you run out and are forced to return to base.

## Purpose
My real purpose here was to deepen my knowledge of React and also familiarize myself with using SVG in the browser space.  Graphics were originally drawn in InkScape and then ported into the game.  To make everything fit I created a scaler function that can grow/shrink things down to fit depending on the size of your screen.

## ToDo's 
This game is now mostly functional however there is still some work remaining that will be completed soon:
* Scoring
* Limit shots
* Title screen/click to start 
* Unit tests
